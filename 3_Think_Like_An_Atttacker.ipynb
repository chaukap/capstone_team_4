    "In our threat model, an attacker has a preconditioned notion of Oski's odds of being a balding bear. Then the attacker observes many runs of a query on the database and observes the results.  These results present an approximation of the \"Likelihood Ratio\".  Let's say the Likelihood Ratio moves the attacker from his initial belief to a stronger belief that Oski is more likely to be in the database.  This is the Posterior Odd's Ratio. Practically speaking, at some point if he gains enough information, those post observation odds for the attacker will breach a practical threshold which, in his mind, is a decision point.  At that decision point, (when the odds are high enough), the attacker will conclude Oksi is in the database. Oski's privacy will be violated.\n",

    "In our example, let's assume that if the attacker's Odd's Ratio moves to greater than 2.  In statsitical vernacular, the Attacker has a Posterior Odds Ratio > 2, he concludes that Oksi is in the database and for this attacker he is willing to tell the world of his findings and Oski's privacy will be breached.\n",
